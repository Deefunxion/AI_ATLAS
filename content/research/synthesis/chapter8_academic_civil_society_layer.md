# Title: Peripheral Resistance: Academia and Civil Society in the AI Ecosystem

# 

# Executive Summary

# 

# Academic institutions and civil society actors have played a formative role in the public understanding of artificial intelligence—producing critical analysis, surfacing harms, and shaping regulatory discourse. Yet their influence on the direction of AI development has remained marginal. Positioned outside the core zones of model training, capital allocation, and platform governance, these groups operate in structurally precarious conditions: underfunded, politically constrained, and increasingly dependent on the very actors they aim to scrutinize.

# 

# This chapter examines the dual role of academia and civil society as sources of critique and providers of legitimacy. It maps their contributions, identifies their structural constraints, and evaluates their limited access to meaningful governance influence—despite occupying much of the rhetorical space in AI ethics and accountability debates.

# 

# Academic researchers were among the first to identify key risks associated with machine learning systems, including algorithmic discrimination, labor precarity, and the feedback loops embedded in recommender systems. Interdisciplinary collaborations between computer science, law, and the social sciences generated some of the foundational vocabularies now used to debate AI: fairness, transparency, accountability, bias, explainability. Yet these terms have often been co-opted into corporate governance frameworks that strip them of political edge, transforming critical scholarship into compliance language.

# 

# The structural position of academic researchers has weakened over time. As AI labs and major platforms absorbed top machine learning talent through aggressive recruitment, many university programs found themselves under-resourced and outpaced. Research funding increasingly depends on partnerships with the same firms under scrutiny, often with non-disclosure agreements or publication delays. Independent investigation into large model behavior, training data provenance, or deployment effects is rare, not due to lack of expertise, but due to lack of access.

# 

# Civil society groups, NGOs, and advocacy organizations have attempted to fill this gap by surfacing case studies of harm, tracking deployment in sensitive domains, and articulating frameworks for rights-based governance. Their work has been essential in translating technical discourse into democratic demands. But they too face structural limitations. Most operate on short-term grants, with limited technical infrastructure, and under pressure to demonstrate policy relevance in rapidly shifting legislative environments. Their interventions are often reactive—responding to crises or high-profile leaks—rather than structurally embedded in the AI lifecycle.

# 

# Attempts to formalize the role of external critique in governance frameworks have yielded mixed results. Participatory audits, public red-teaming, and civil society consultations are increasingly invoked in principle, but rarely backed with resources or decision-making power. In regulatory drafting processes, civil society input is often invited late and under compressed timelines. Academic research may be cited, but seldom incorporated into implementation plans. The epistemic authority to define harm or risk remains concentrated in technical labs and corporate safety teams.

# 

# Efforts to build independent capacity for model auditing and AI evaluation outside industry are ongoing but uneven. A few initiatives—such as DAIR, the AI Now Institute, or AlgorithmWatch—have attempted to create sustained structures for independent scrutiny. But these efforts remain small relative to the scale of the systems they address. Infrastructure access remains a key barrier. Without GPU access, full-weight models, or real-time deployment data, independent actors can only audit surface behavior or second-order effects. This limits their ability to intervene at the level of design, training, or rollout strategy.

# Peripheral Resistance: Academia and Civil Society in the AI Ecosystem

# 

# One of the core dilemmas for academic and civil society actors is the ambiguity of their role. They are framed as watchdogs, but often deployed as consultants. Their function as outside critics is undermined by their growing proximity to policy pipelines shaped by industry interests. Multi-stakeholder initiatives and co-governance processes frequently invoke balance, but reproduce asymmetries of power in participation, access, and influence. The presence of civil society actors at the table does not guarantee they can shape the menu.

# 

# The co-option of critical vocabulary into corporate governance is especially visible in the rise of AI “ethics” teams within major labs and platforms. These teams often adopt academic language while being structurally subordinate to product or legal divisions. Their remit may include fairness or transparency, but typically avoids questions of structural inequality, extractive labor practices, or geopolitical entanglement. When such teams raise concerns beyond narrow safety parameters, they face internal marginalization or public disbandment—as seen in multiple high-profile dismissals.

# 

# Civil society actors are often expected to serve as friction without being given the means to meaningfully redirect momentum. Their task becomes the mitigation of harm at the margins, not the negotiation of core goals. In this environment, even successful interventions tend to be localized and symbolic. A misleading deployment is paused; a dataset is retracted; a problematic model is renamed or sunset. But the conditions that produce these harms—funding structures, deployment incentives, centralization of infrastructure—remain untouched.

# 

# One area of promise lies in transnational solidarity and coalition-building. Civil society groups in the Global South have increasingly challenged the assumption that AI governance should follow norms developed in the U.S. and Europe. They point to linguistic erasure, cultural misrepresentation, and infrastructural dependencies as structural forms of harm. These critiques expand the field beyond fairness and transparency, situating AI within histories of colonialism, labor exploitation, and global extraction. Such work reframes AI not as a technical system requiring adjustment, but as a political artifact embedded in unequal systems.

# 

# Despite these advances, institutional capacity for critique remains limited. Public funding for independent AI research is inconsistent. Legal frameworks often lag behind deployment practices. Media coverage is episodic and crisis-driven, more reactive than analytical. Academic conferences and journals are still dominated by benchmarks and incremental improvements rather than structural or critical inquiry. In this landscape, civil society and academia must spend as much energy sustaining their operations as producing new knowledge or interventions.

# 

# For governance frameworks to benefit from these perspectives, they must treat critique as infrastructure, not opposition. This means funding independent audit labs, granting access to models and logs, and integrating external researchers into red-teaming, eval, and deployment review. It also means building pathways for public deliberation—not only on how AI should behave, but on where and whether it should be deployed at all.

# 

# As we move to Chapter 9, the lens turns from critique to control. The next layer of the ecosystem is not visible in developer blogs or regulatory proposals. It lies in the military, surveillance, and intelligence infrastructures that shape how AI systems are used to monitor, target, and influence populations. There, the politics of AI are no longer speculative or future-facing—they are already operational.
