- Israeli stack: AI surveillance in Gaza (2024-2025), war crimes allegations, ICC probes. No single anonymous source claims prioritized.

### Analysis
Dual-use AI in military/surveillance has surged since 2024, blending commercial tech with defense. Trends: proliferation of AI for predictive analytics (LAPD/Frontex) and facial recognition (Clearview/NEC), enabling rapid deployments but amplifying biases. Contracts like Palantir's $10B Army deal and Anduril's $642M CUAS highlight U.S. dominance, while Helsing's €600M funding shows European pushback against Russian threats. Chokepoints include data supply chains—vulnerable to breaches—and talent shortages, with U.S./Israeli firms leading. Export controls interplay: U.S. sanctions on Hikvision/SenseTime curb misuse in Xinjiang but fragment markets, forcing diversification (e.g., NEC in India). Rights risks escalate: AI enables mass profiling, eroding privacy (Clearview settlements) and fueling discrimination (predictive policing studies). Efficacy is mixed—high in border ops (Frontex drones) but low in equity, per NGO reports. Misuse, like Israeli AI in Gaza, risks war crimes. Action: enforce global standards, audit biases, ban high-risk exports. Without, trends risk dystopian surveillance states. (398 words)
